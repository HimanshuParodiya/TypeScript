1) Typescript provides 3 benefits. Easy to read Easy to write Easy to maintain  


2) Typescript is a superset of javascript

3) Javascript is a dynamically typed language 
Example = let firstName = "Jay"
firstName = 100;
firstName = true;

console.log(firstName) // true

Typescript is a statically typed language 
let firstName:string = "Jay"
firstName = 100
firstName = true 

console.log(firstName) // error firstName must be a string or something like that


4) TypeScript catches errors at compile time
instead of runtime, which makes
debugging easier and reduces the
likelihood of bugs in production.


5) Browsers don't support TypeScript so the TypeScript file will compile to a javascript file then it will run in Browser



6)ts and tsx 

tsx use for files that include JSX
ts is for a normal js file
